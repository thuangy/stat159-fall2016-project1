![Stat159 Logo](../images/stat159-logo.png)

The purpose of this stat159 project is to give brief descriptions of Makefiles, Git and Github, Pandoc, and Markdown, as well as how to use them. I hope to make it easier for others who may not be familiar with these tools to still be able to use them and improve their workflows. In addition, this project will also make it easier for me to look back on these tools as a reminder on how to use them.
